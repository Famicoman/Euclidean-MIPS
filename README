Two programs that calculated the greatest common factor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
Written in MIPS assembly. Tested in PCspim.

The first of these was an iterative approach. The program asks the users for integers in main, and then calls a function which contains a loop to calculate the greatest common factor.  

The second program also takes user input of two integers through main, but has a recursive implementation of the Euclid algorithm that calls itself to calculate the greatest common factor.
